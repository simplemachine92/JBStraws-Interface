# Juicebox Straws Interface

This was built for the [Juicebox Delegate Hackathon](https://docs.juicebox.money/delegate-hackathon/)

Contracts are deployed on goerli, the merkle calculations on the front-end are currently botched as I tried to meet the deadline of the hackathon, but contract interactions should be working fine. [Contract Source](https://github.com/simplemachine92/JBStraws-Contracts)
